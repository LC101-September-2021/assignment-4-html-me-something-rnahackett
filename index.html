            <h2>Why sustainability?</h2>
            <p id = "testP" class = "funParagraph">
               We are often excited by new discoveries and innovations. Yet we also need to sustain what we know works. 
               How we can ensure that effective public health programs continue to provide benefits to our communities? 
               Money may be one of the first things to come to mind, but a sustainable program often has more than funding. 
               Looking across programs, you often see that, even with the same level of funding, some programs are able to 
               sustain and others are not. 
            <p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1748-5908-8-15" target="_blank">
               Program Sustainability Framework</a> (shown below) identifies eight factors that can help programs withstand 
               challenges and changes. This may look like adapting your program activities to a crisis like a pandemic. 
               Or it may be more routine such as planning how to continue services once a grant ends.

               We define <i>program sustainability</i> as the ability to maintain programming and its benefits over time. 
               The definition is intentionally broad because sustainability looks different for each program based on program needs, 
               goals, and funding. But the general idea is to have an aware and flexible program that you are actively 
               adapting to respond to changes as needed.

            <h2>How can you sustain your program?</h2>
            <p>
               Sustaining programs takes active planning. Public health and other types of Programs can use the <b>Program Sustainability 
               Action Planning</b> process to build sustainability capacity by strengthening the eight sustainability domains. The process has
               three steps:

            <h3>1.Understand</h3>
            <p>
               The first step is to build your understanding of the factors that impact your program sustainability. Learn more about the 
               eight sustainability domains <a href="https://sustaintool.org/psat/understand/" target="_blank">here</a>.
               Increasing your knowledge of these critical factors can help demystify sustainability by
               showing programs how they can take action to best position their efforts for long-term success.

         <section>
            <h3>2.Assess</h3>
            <p>
               The second step is to assess your program sustainability capacity by completing the <b>Program Sustainability Assessment Tool (PSAT)</b>. 
               The PSAT is a self-assessment that can be used by both program staff and stakeholders to evaluate the sustainability capacity of a program. 
               It includes five questions about each of the eight sustainability domains (40 questions total). When you take the assessment 
               <a href="https://sustaintool.org/psat/understand/" target="_blank">online</a>, you will receive a summary report of your overall sustainability, 
               which can be used to inform program planning.  
            </p>

            <h3>3.Plan</h3>
            <p>
               The final step is to use the assessment results to create a sustainability action plan focused on increasing 
               capacity for sustainability in a chosen domain. Think about which domains are most important to your program and
               feasible to make a change in. You do not have to necessarily focus on the lowest-scoring domains. Instead consider 
               how you can leverage program strengths to address weaknesses or gaps. Below is an example of a sustainability action plan.
