            <h2>Why sustainability?</h2>
            <p id = "testP" class = "funParagraph">
               We are often excited by new discoveries and innovations, yet we also need to sustain what we know works. 
               How we can ensure that effective public health programs continue to provide benefits to our communities? 
               Money may be one of the first things to come to mind, but a sustainable program often has more than funding. 
               Looking across programs, you often see that, even with the same level of funding, some programs are able to 
               sustain themselves and others are not. The Program Sustainability Framework identifies eight factors that can help 
               programs withstand challenges and changes. This may look like adapting your services to a crisis like a pandemic. 
               Or it may be more routine such as planning how to continue your services once a grant ends. We define program 
               sustainability as the ability to maintain programming and its benefits over time.

            <h2>Action planning process</h2>
            <p>
               Sustaining programs takes active planning. The Program Sustainabiilty Action PLanning process involves three
               steps programs can take to build capacity for sustainability by strengthening one or more of the eight sustainability
               domains. The three steps are:

            <h3>1.Understand</h3>
            <p>
               The first step is to build your understanding of the factors that impact your program sustainability.

            <h3>2.Assess</h3>
            <p>
               he second step is to assess your program sustainability capacity by completing either the PSAT.

            <h3>3.Plan</h3>
            <p>
               But the final step is to use the assessment results to create a sustainability action plan focused on increasing 
               capacity for sustainability in a chosen domain
